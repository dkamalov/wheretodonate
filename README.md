Hi!

Its an extremely simple straightforward website that I wanted to make based on a capstone project I did while in a coding bootcamp. I was extremely motivated and the 
entire website from conception to final build took a little less than a week. Or maybe a little over a week, this is a retrospective written over 6 months later. 

Looking back this was an excellent project, it still has a lot of potential to grow however I have so many other things to work on. Personally after the way I implemented 
this I am looking forward to working with similar OpenNYC API's. As during the course of this I found out how extensive that database is. 

It was designed by a good friend, very good designer. I am now very well aware of a lot of subtle quality of life things that good websites do. As well as modern website design techniques. It really is a cute website with a lovely homepage. Just amazing. 

Probably one of the most fun projects I've worked on. It was fantastic to collaborate with a designer and I do feel solid about communicating in that language. As well as really enjoying the process rather than just the result. 

I have so much to work on, not the least properly laying out the code so it's not confusing in the 11th hour. It worked out in the end but there is so much to make efficient its crazy. If I had a mentor figure coding wise throughout this I think it would be a much cleaner program. I mean it's not bad, it runs well but it could be better. 

What a month too, Feb 2021. Yea this is enough, I'll ramble if I go too long and I get wayyyyy too much of a kick writing stream of mind. 

Whoever is reading have a wonderful day.
